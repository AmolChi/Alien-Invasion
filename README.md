# Alien-Invasion
It is a pygame project based on the book Python Crash Course

This project is basically a culmination of using pygame library with class and object concept to create a game in which a player has to press space bar for shooting bullets and shoot the aliens
  The user gets 3 lives
  This project also saves a global score in score.json file. So file handling part of python is also covered in this project
  Currently working on encryption and decryption libraries in python for better safety of this score.json file
  It uses Pygame, pygame.sprite for the screen processes
